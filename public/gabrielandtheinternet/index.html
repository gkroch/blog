      <p>I believe the traditional greeting is <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Programming/Hello_world">&quot;Hello,
world.&quot;</a></p>
<p>My name is Gabriel. Here are my thoughts and my ramblings, my passionate
essays and rantings. The words on these digital pages are firstly for
myself - just to organize the insides of my head. And yet, I leave this in
full view of the whole world, in some sense. Good luck to me, then.</p>
<p><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<p>There are few acts more mundane in 2018 than publishing your thoughts on
the internet. We have access to audiences of millions, through the wonders
of TCP/IP and social media.  We construct tweets carelessly tossed into
the national discourse, antagonizing superstar athletes and criticizing
politicians. We take elegant pictures filtered through both digital and
social lenses, so that all these strangers can salivate over the food
we just ate. Somehow, humanity has found a way to scream into the
collective void and have the void scream back.</p>
<p>There is nothing special about my writings or my opinions.  I am just
another of those millions yelling.</p>
<p>In 2018, the separations between truth and fiction are blurred.  I suppose
I am just trying to find a way to make sense of the endless firehose of
information.  Maybe all this public bellowing is our way of such an
attempt. Maybe I'm just re-teaching myself how to write; after all, it has
been a few years since my last dose of critical English writing.</p>
<p>At the very least, such an endeavour is worth a digital toast.  So, here's
to the internet, with all its scars and with all its beauty. As always,
take everything you read out here with a large helping of salt. And wish
me luck.</p>
