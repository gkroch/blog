The hearings of Thursday, September 27th were a study in contrasts. I am
by no means the first to point this out, but, truly, it was stark.  Let's
start with the protagonists of our most recent national crisis here in the
United States of America: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Professor of
Psychology and victim of sexual assault, and the Honorable Brett
Kavanaugh, judge on the DC Circuit and candidate for the Supreme Court.
From the outset, Dr. Blasey was collected and measured, despite clearly
reliving the trauma of assault in real-time in front of the whole nation.
Kavanaugh's attitude was diametrically opposed, combative and furious. The
[Saturday Night Live cold open]() was less embellished than one would have hoped.

Dr. Blasey Ford behaved exactly as needed to be deemed "credible."  Is
there a soul who believes that if she had come to hearing visibly fuming,
she would have been treated with respect?  President Trump was allegedly
disconcerted by her testimony, caught off guard by how "credible" she
appeared. Dr. Blasey Ford was obligated to be calm, despite the emotions
she may have been experiencing in the moment.  Of course, this is couched
in sexism and our expectations from men and women, extending to (or from?)
behavior in the workplace.  It's hard not to see the parallels with the
last presidential election.

Especially given the performance of Kavanaugh, flipping pages in his
binder with righteous rage.
